### Not a rockstar, just a person who keeps the chaos shippable
- I have started as a full-stack PHP developer, but later focused on **mobile and frontend development** as UX has always been my main interest.
- I‚Äôm quite flexible, though I thrive best working with strongly typed languages, in cross-functional teams, and a culture of collaborative learning and respectful communication.
- I‚Äôm not afraid to do deep research when context is missing or a domain feels unfamiliar.
- Sometimes I lead, sometimes I follow ‚Äî as long as a thing ships, I‚Äôm happy.
- I know when to ask ‚Äúwhy‚Äù before touching ‚Äúhow‚Äù.
- My main strength is product ownership.

### 10 years of hands-on experience in tech
- I‚Äôve owned entire products solo ‚Äî from client communication and backend logic to frontend and design decisions.
Did I burn out? Oh, yeah. Did I learn more than any course could teach me? Also yes.
- I‚Äôve worked on enterprise monorepos with clearly split backend/frontend roles ‚Äî and learned how to collaborate without silos.
- I‚Äôve had the luck of working with a great tech lead who showed me how to survive in cross-platform mobile projects.
- I‚Äôve mentored others.

### What made me start coding?
I kept running into apps and websites that were missing the features I needed.
So I started building my own ‚Äî Chrome extensions and tools to fill those gaps.
For example, [this extension](https://youtu.be/4_J4AvmPMNo?si=Z-PdDIQauuuIsZDP) that translates subtitles helped me a lot in learning English.

### These days, I mostly work with
Typescript, React Native, Vue, React, Expo, Cursor/Windsurf

### Startups, products, business
Got something you're building or growing? I‚Äôm all ears ‚Äî I love hearing how people turn ideas into real things.
I‚Äôm deeply interested in every stage of product development ‚Äî from scrappy ideas to delivery, growth, pivots, and even the post-mortems.

### Outside work
I like to hang out with my dog, reading (non-fiction, for example, health/biology), traveling, meeting new people,
especially from other cultures or backgrounds, hunting for the next pair of funny socks.
Open to go to conferences (anything tech-related), networking events, meetups, and places where animals are kept in good conditions.

I'm an immigrant, I speak English, Polish, Ukrainian, and Russian.

When I‚Äôm not chasing deadlines or my dog ‚Äì happy to collaborate or just chat over coffee.
