### Hi! My name is Olga
- I have started as a full-stack PHP developer, but later focused on **mobile and frontend development** as UX has always been my main interest.
- I‚Äôm quite flexible, though I thrive best in environments with strong typing languages, cross-functional teams and collaborative learning.
- My main strength is product ownership.
- I know when to ask ‚Äúwhy‚Äù before touching ‚Äúhow‚Äù.
- Sometimes I lead, sometimes I follow ‚Äî as long as a thing ships, I‚Äôm happy.

### Why I became a developer?
I kept running into apps and websites that were missing the features I needed.
So I started building my own ‚Äî Chrome extensions and tools to fill those gaps.
For example, this extension that translates subtitles helped me a lot in learning English ‚Äî https://youtu.be/4_J4AvmPMNo?si=Z-PdDIQauuuIsZDP.

### 10 years of hands-on experience in tech
- I‚Äôve owned entire products solo ‚Äî from client communication and backend logic to frontend and design decisions.
- I‚Äôve worked on enterprise monorepos with clearly split backend/frontend roles ‚Äî and learned how to collaborate without silos.
- I‚Äôve had the luck of working with a great tech lead who showed me how to survive in cross-platform mobile projects.
- I‚Äôve mentored others.

### Current tech stack
Typescript, React Native, Vue, React, Expo, Cursor

### Startups, products, business
Got something you're building/growing? I‚Äôm all ears ‚Äî I love hearing how people turn ideas into real things.

### Outside work
I like to hang out with my dog, reading (non-fiction, for example, health/biology), traveling, meeting new people,
especially from other cultures or backgrounds, hunting for the next pair of funny socks.
Open to go to conferences (anything tech-related), networking events, meetups and places where animals are kept in good conditions.

I'm an immigrant, I speak English, Polish, Ukrainian and Russian.

Not a rockstar. Just a person who keeps the chaos shippable.
