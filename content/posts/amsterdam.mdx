## I'm opened minded + I knew where I was going -> still got a cultural shock

We landed in Eindhoven (the Dutch Łódź?), then took a Flixbus to the capital (it was €0.99 cheaper than flying straight to Amsterdam).

### Amsterdam has clean and grimy vibes at the same time

A street-cleaning vehicle (like a big Roomba) operates once or twice a day in some areas. <br />

But most trash cans we saw in Amsterdam were like these. <br />
Even away from tourist areas (Bijlmer, for example).

### There are more bikes than people

It's a very well-known fact, but I didn't expect to see THAT number of bikes.

        This is a cargo bike, it’s used to transport pretty much anything: kids, dogs (if there are no kids or if the dog outranks them), groceries for a week — including a cheese wheel the size of your thigh, IKEA furniture, Christmas trees

### Public transport

Everything we used was on time, like a clockwork.

But public transport is brutal and can leave you behind. <br />
There were five of us.
One friend stepped onto the bus, the doors closed in our faces (it was time to go), and he was gone. <br />
Just… poof. <br />
The rest of us stood there like we’d just lost a comrade to public infrastructure. <br />
The next bus was in 10 minutes, so it wasn't that bad, just unexpected. <br />

The system is cashless — you pay with a card. <br />
It's not cheap, the price depends on how far do you ride. <br />
You need to check in and **check out** with your card, so the system will know how much to charge you.

Once we saw Dutch ticket inspectors on the train — they were super friendly, smiling, not hunting.
Huge contrast with Poland, where controllers often get bonuses from each fine.. and it shows.

### Staircases are not friendly

In the 17th century, houses were taxed by width, so people built narrow and tall buildings and made the stairs steep and narrow to save space.
Old steps are often only 15 cm deep, much smaller than the modern standard (30 cm), making them uncomfortable and dangerous.
New buildings have been required to follow strict safety regulations since 1992.

### Ducks and dicks, they are everywhere in tourist areas

### Live porno and 5d porno

Don't take photos in areas where sex-workers can get into the shot

### School backpack on a balcony
