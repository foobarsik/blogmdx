## I'm opened minded + I knew where I was going -> still got a cultural shock

We landed in Eindhoven, then took a Flixbus to the capital and our two-day sprint in Amsterdam began.

### Public transport

Everything we used was on time, like a clockwork.

But Dutch public transport sticks to the schedule ruthlessly and can leave you behind. <br />
There were five of us.
One friend stepped onto the bus, the doors closed in our faces (it was time to go), and the friend was gone. <br />
The rest of us stood there like we‚Äôd just lost a comrade to public infrastructure. <br />
The next bus was in 10 minutes, so it wasn't that bad, just unexpected. <br />

The system is cashless ‚Äî you pay with a card. <br />
It's not cheap. The price depends on how far do you ride. <br />
You need to check in and **check out** with your card, so the system will know how much to charge you.

On one train ride we met Dutch ticket inspectors ‚Äî super friendly, smiling, not hunting.
Huge contrast with Poland, where inspectors often get bonuses from each fine.. And it shows.

### There are more bikes than people

It's a very well-known fact, but I didn't expect to see THAT number of bikes.

### Amsterdam has clean and grimy vibes at the same time

A street-cleaning vehicle (like a big Roomba) operates once or twice a day in some areas. <br />

But most of the trash cans we saw in Amsterdam had trash all around them. <br />
Even away from tourist areas (Bijlmer, for example).

### Staircases are not friendly

In the 17th century, houses were taxed by width, so people built narrow and tall buildings and made the stairs steep and narrow to save space.
Old steps are often only 15 cm deep, much smaller than the modern standard (30 cm), making them uncomfortable and dangerous.
New buildings have been required to follow strict safety regulations since 1992.

### 'Nothing to hide' mentality

### Backpack + flag == school is over

This is a classic Dutch tradition ‚Äî hanging a school bag and a national flag to celebrate passing final high school exams.

### Ducks and dicks, they are everywhere in tourist areas

### Live porno, 5D porno

Everything is within a 5-minute walk ‚Äî sex shows, museums, novelty shops, church.
Amsterdam's Red-Light District really knows how to keep things compact.

*Don‚Äôt take photos in areas where sex workers might end up in the frame.*
*Despite all that freedom, some prefer to keep their work private.*
