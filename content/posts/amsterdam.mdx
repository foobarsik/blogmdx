## I'm opened minded + I knew where I was going -> still got a cultural shock

We landed in Eindhoven (the Dutch Łódź?), then took a Flixbus to the capital (it was €0.99 cheaper than flying straight to Amsterdam).

### Amsterdam has clean and grimy vibes at the same time

A street-cleaning vehicle (like a big Roomba) operates once or twice a day in some areas. <br />

But most trash cans we saw in Amsterdam were like these. <br />
Even away from tourist areas (Bijlmer, for example).

### There are more bikes than people

It's a very well-known fact, but I didn't expect to see THAT number of bikes.

    <figcaption>This is a cargo bike, it’s used to transport pretty much anything: kids, dogs (if there are no kids or if the dog outranks them),
