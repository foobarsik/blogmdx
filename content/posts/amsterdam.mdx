### Two-day trip with a lot of tourist traps

We landed in Eindhoven, then took a Flixbus to the capital and our two-day sprint in Amsterdam began.

### Public transport UX

Everything we used was on time, like clockwork.

But Dutch public transport sticks to the schedule ruthlessly and can leave you behind. <br />
There were five of us.
One friend made it onto the bus, the doors closed in our faces (it was time to go), and the friend was gone. <br />
The rest of us stood there like we‚Äôd just lost a comrade to public infrastructure. <br />
The next bus was in 10 minutes, so it wasn't that bad, just unexpected. <br />

The system is cashless ‚Äî you pay with a card. <br />
It's not cheap. The price depends on how far you ride. <br />
You need to check in and **check out** with your card, so the system will know how much to charge you.
<figure>
    <ImageZoom src="/images/amsterdam/bus.jpg" alt="bus" width={330}/>
    <figcaption>Just hold your card for a moment, no need to tap anything</figcaption>
</figure>

**Using trains has never been easier.** Zero stress or confusion for a tourist.<br />
Platforms are often split into zones ‚Äî like 2a and 2b ‚Äî which refer to specific sections of a single physical platform.
It‚Äôs not a different track, just a more precise way to tell you where exactly your train will stop.
Zones also help spread people out, instead of everyone clumping together at random spots.

On one train ride we met Dutch ticket inspectors ‚Äî super friendly, smiling, not hunting.
You can tell they are not getting bonuses from each fine, like in some countries (yes, Poland, I'm looking at you üòí).

Metro system is considered one of the more accessible in Europe, particularly for wheelchair users and visually impaired.

The ferry across the IJ river is free ‚Äî fast, reliable, even at night.
Just don‚Äôt expect a peaceful ride if you want to stand and enjoy the view ‚Äî you‚Äôll have to fight for a spot with bikes.

### There are more bikes than people

It's a very well-known fact, but I didn't expect to see THAT number of bikes.
<figure>

</figure>

<figure>
    <ImageZoom src="/images/amsterdam/bike.jpg" alt="bikes" width={330}/>
    <figcaption>Cargo bike is used to transport pretty much anything: kids, dogs (if there are no kids or if the dog
        outranks them), groceries for a week ‚Äî including a cheese wheel the size of your thigh, IKEA furniture,
        Christmas trees</figcaption>
</figure>

### Amsterdam has clean and grimy vibes at the same time

A street-cleaning vehicle (like a big Roomba) operates once or twice a day in some areas. <br />
<figure>
    <ImageZoom src="/images/amsterdam/xxx.jpg" alt="street-cleaning vehicle" width={330}/>
    <figcaption>The triple X (‚®Ø‚®Ø‚®Ø) is Amsterdam‚Äôs city symbol ‚Äî no, it‚Äôs not porn-related</figcaption>
</figure>

But most of the trash cans we saw in Amsterdam had trash all around them. <br />
Even away from tourist areas (Bijlmer, for example).
<div style={{display: 'flex', gap: '1rem'}}>

### Staircases will give you a Post-Traumatic Stair Disorder

In the 17th century, houses were taxed by width, so people built narrow and tall buildings and made the stairs steep and narrow to save space.
Old steps are often only 15 cm deep, much smaller than the modern standard (30 cm), making them uncomfortable and dangerous.
New buildings have been required to follow strict safety regulations since 1992.

We had to walk down with our feet sideways, gripping handrails like our lives depends on it.

</div>

### 'Nothing to hide' mentality

Reading about it is one thing ‚Äî seeing it is another. <br />
A Dutch couple casually playing cards inside with curtains wide open while dozens of tourists pass by every second ‚Äî respect for not giving a damn.

### If you go in June, you will be confused by hanging out backpacks

This is a classic Dutch tradition ‚Äî hanging a school bag and a national flag to celebrate passing final high school exams.
<ImageZoom src="/images/amsterdam/backpack.jpg" alt="ducks" width={330}/>

### Ducks and dicks. Tourist areas are full of them

    <figcaption>Those Kens probably don't need Barbie</figcaption>
</figure>

### Red-Light District really knows how to keep things compact

Everything is within a 5-minute walk ‚Äî sex shows, museums, novelty shops, church.
<figure>
    <ImageZoom src="/images/amsterdam/5d.jpg" alt="dicks" width={300}/>
    <figcaption>Most likely it‚Äôs just 4D with extra marketing and more questionable vibrations</figcaption>
</figure>

Contrary to popular belief, Amsterdam doesn‚Äôt have just one Red-Light District ‚Äî it has at least three.
Each comes with its own atmosphere, clientele, and challenges.
<figure>
    <ImageZoom src="/images/amsterdam/liveporno.jpg" alt="dicks" width={330}/>
    <figcaption>Real people have sex on stage in front of an audience üëÄ</figcaption>
</figure>

Window prostitution isn‚Äôt just a quirky ‚ÄúAmsterdam thing.‚Äù It emerged due to the ban on street-based sex work.
That‚Äôs how/why the model was born: sex workers rent a window, like an office, and attract clients through gestures or a knock on the glass.

Not all sex workers stand behind glass. Other formats exist:
massage parlors (offering ‚Äúextras‚Äù under the label of wellness), independent escorting, agencies.

**Don‚Äôt take photos in areas where sex workers might end up in the frame.** <br />
Sex work may be legal in the Netherlands ‚Äî but the stigma is very much alive.
Many sex workers keep their profession secret from family, friends, neighbors.
Just one photo posted online can destroy their life. <br />
It‚Äôs especially sensitive for workers with migrant backgrounds, where conservative values dominate.

The Netherlands isn‚Äôt a land of total freedom.
It‚Äôs a place where sex work is legal but stigmatized, regulated but inconsistent, tolerated but judged.

### Weed is not legal, just tolerated

Coffeeshops operate in strange legal limbo: they're **legal to sell weed, but not to buy it, grow it or keep too much of it**. <br />
How much weed can a Coffeeshop sell? Tons per day, no limits.
But they can only store 500 grams at a time.
How do they survive? With tiny, repeated deliveries all day long.
And since the police have bigger problems than chasing down coffeeshop supply chains, the whole thing just keeps rolling.
<figure>
    <ImageZoom src="/images/amsterdam/bulldog.jpg" alt="bulldog coffeeshop" width={330}/>

    <ImageZoom src="/images/amsterdam/joint.jpg" alt="bulldog coffeeshop" width={330}/>
    <figcaption>Tourists aren‚Äôt just looking for a joint ‚Äî they‚Äôre chasing an experience.
        So Henk built a brand: a logo, a signature style, merchandise.
        His English bulldog became the logo.</figcaption>

        When the bartender spotted police, he‚Äôd drop an orange down a hidden tube.</figcaption>
</figure>

*"Ten Dutch cities are now part of a four‚Äëyear pilot that allows around 80 coffeeshops to sell cannabis only from licensed, state‚Äëapproved growers.
The aim? To end the longstanding ‚Äúlegal‚Äëfront, illegal‚Äëback‚Äù paradox, improve product safety, and gather data for a possible nationwide regulated market."*

### Tourist traps and what we managed to visit during those 2 days

The whole center feels like one big tourist trap, but it‚Äôs not that bad ‚Äî no one‚Äôs aggressively trying to sell you stuff like in Egypt.
Still, it‚Äôs hard to catch a glimpse of Dutch culture or even get a sense of what Dutch people look like because everything is tailored for tourists.

Usually, when I plan a trip, I check Reddit for local recommendations on what to skip to avoid traps or crowds, it's not perfect, but helps.
But this time was different ‚Äî we just went for it.

### Brothel Tour with Former Sex Worker
Highly praised. Informative, respectful and candid. Educational, not sleazy.
Without doubt, it was my fav.

### Cheese Tasting
Ok for the money, the guide guy was very nice, I enjoyed it, but it‚Äôs not for *advanced* cheese users, more suitable for first time cheese tasting tourists. <br />
<figure>
    <ImageZoom src="/images/amsterdam/Henri.jpg" alt="Henri Willing" width={330}/>
    <figcaption>Henri inherited a goat farm and basically went, ‚ÄúWTF am I gonna do with all that?? Maybe cheese? Yeah, I‚Äôll do cheese, yolo‚Äù</figcaption>
</figure>
Respect to Dutch marketing skills, they have pulled off the ultimate cheese con.
They took one recipe, split it into a thousand timelines, sprinkled it with cumin, truffle, or lavender, gave each version a new label ‚Äî and sold the world a dream of endless variety.
Meanwhile, the French are still in a cave somewhere, arguing about mold and terroir.
France makes 400 kinds of cheese, the Netherlands makes 400 kinds of Gouda.

Each of us got *four* pieces of different cheeses (plus mustard and some cheese dip souse) and a glass of wine. My fav was probably *Goat Extra Old*.

And at the end, there was an unexpected bonus ‚Äì something that looked like swiss *T√™te de Moine*, cheese that isn‚Äôt sliced but shaved into delicate rosettes using a special tool called a girolle.
This technique releases its full nutty, creamy aroma and turns cheese into edible petals.
Each rosette was served with wine-soaked grapes ‚Äì soft, rich, and slightly boozy, like tiny flavor bombs.

### Sexmuseum
Ok for it's *relatively* low price, though you can visit one of the Sex Shops in the Red-light district to see sex-related items for free.

Altogether it feels like someone‚Äôs garage full of sex-related collectibles: coconut in the form of ass, mechanical dudes with boners, vintage posters, nude photos, NSFW art, vulva-cake.
Even the full-size figure of Marilyn Monroe, because, you know, she was a *sex* symbol. My fav was probably Asian area.
<figure>
    <ImageZoom src="/images/amsterdam/octupus.jpg" alt="The Dream of the Fisherman‚Äôs Wife" width={330}/>
    <figcaption>‚ÄúThe Dream of the Fisherman‚Äôs Wife‚Äù is one of the earliest and most iconic tentacle-erotic artworks in history.
        In Japan, such shunga prints weren‚Äôt seen as porn until Western norms arrived in the 19th century.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Heineken Experience
Considered one of the top tourist traps. Locals don‚Äôt go there.
Boring, expensive, and the drinks at the end don‚Äôt redeem it.

I don‚Äôt like beer and only went along with friends.
Knew I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy and had low expectations, but it‚Äôs still managed to disappoint me.
The worst part was sitting in a dark room, staring at a big screen showing us promo video with how bottles get filled with beer and magically teleport to a party.
Meanwhile, I‚Äôm just sitting there watching people on screen have fun, like some background NPC.
Not enjoying something is one thing. But feeling like a moron ‚Äî that‚Äôs a new level.
And way too many people at once ‚Äî we couldn‚Äôt even find a place to sit with our drinks.

Any random bar would‚Äôve been a better choice.

### House of Bols
Ok for cocktail lovers, though short. We had an audio guide, I dislike those things and strongly prefer a human one, so that was big meh for me.
The atmosphere was nice, quiet, not crowded.
<ImageZoom src="/images/amsterdam/cocktail.jpg" alt="Cocktail" width={330}/>

### The Bulldog Boat
Chill, fun ride, especially at the end of the day. Not too historical ‚Äî just good vibes.
Most people smoked joints during the ride.

### Rijksmuseum
The national museum of the Netherlands, focused mainly on Dutch art, history, and culture ‚Äî Rembrandt, Vermeer, weapons collections, ship models.

Doing a museum like this with four friends is a struggle ‚Äî everyone has their own taste and tempo, and it turns into a low-key logistical nightmare.

In such museums I usually need a guide to keep me engaged ‚Äî without one, it‚Äôs just old stuff and guesswork.
Didn‚Äôt make it to the end, but found a few gems along the way.
<ImageZoom src="/images/amsterdam/vase.jpg" alt="Vase" width={330}/>

### Micropia
Mixed feelings. I think they did a pretty good job for a Museum of Microbes, but marketing was a bit misleading.

I expected something more personal.
The whole ‚ÄúTry out the Kiss-o-Meter‚Äù thing made me believe there was going to be some interesting personal interaction.
But it was about kiss passion level and just preloaded facts about how many microbes people share when they kiss.
I could‚Äôve googled that while waiting for my train.

### Escape Room "The Alchemist"
In terms of fanciness, it easily outranks any other escape room I‚Äôve been to ‚Äî really well done.
But for me, it wasn‚Äôt worth it.
It‚Äôs like going to an expensive restaurant ‚Äî not everyone‚Äôs vibe.
Honestly, I had more fun in a local crappy escape room with half-working props.
The others seemed to love it, though.

### Westerpark
It's my favorite kind of park ‚Äî the type where people are just lying on the grass near water and chilling. It wasn‚Äôt overcrowded in the evening, has a nice view, and the people were so relaxed that I totally vibed with the atmosphere.
I didn‚Äôt even plan to go there ‚Äî I was just passing by ‚Äî but I couldn‚Äôt resist and ended up spending five hours just hanging out with the ducks.

Unlike Vondelpark, Westerpark doesn‚Äôt feel touristy at all.

    <summary>Reddit recommendations</summary>
    #### ü§° Better Skip

    - Madame Tussauds Amsterdam ‚Äî Commonly rated as overrated. Same wax figures as in other cities, just fewer. Crowds, noise, and all for a couple of selfies.

    - The Amsterdam Dungeon ‚Äî Horror theatre with overacting actors. Many call it a "waste of money". Only for fans of spooky English-style humor.

    - Zaanse Schans Bus Excursion ‚Äî Often slammed as an overpriced trap. Better to go by train on your own. The bus tour is boring and costly.

    - The Upside Down Amsterdam ‚Äî Insta-trap. Photo zones with upside-down rooms. Kids might enjoy it, but adults are often disappointed.

    - Giethoorn Day Trip Including Canal Tour ‚Äî Widely seen as a trap. Lots of buses, crowds, and expensive. Pretty, but feels like a tourist set.

    - Volendam & Zaanse Schans Windmills Bus Excursion ‚Äî Typical checklist tour ‚Äî take photos, see cheese and clogs, leave. Purely touristy, no soul.

    - WONDR Experience ‚Äî Another Insta-trap. Looks nice, but zero substance. Adults without kids are usually disappointed.

    - Day Trip to the Cheese Markets in Gouda or Alkmaar ‚Äî Pure tourist theatre. Crowds and staged auctions. The cheese isn‚Äôt that different from stores.

    - Royal Experience ‚Äì Royal Coster Diamonds ‚Äî Jewelry sales disguised as a tour. Borderline scammy. Best avoided.

    - Rembrandt‚Äôs Amsterdam Experience ‚Äî A trap. Short multimedia showroom mimicking a studio. Go to the real Rembrandthuis instead.

    - Pedal Boat Amsterdam ‚Äî Sounds fun, but tiring and awkward in practice. You‚Äôll block other boats and get exhausted. A normal cruise is better.

    #### ü§î Mixed Reviews

    - Amsterdam Canal Cruise ‚Äî Recommended, especially in the evening. Beautiful views and a good intro to the city. Better to pick smaller companies or an open-boat without an audio guide.

    - A'DAM Lookout ‚Äî Nice panoramic view, but the swing ride is pure tourist bait. Worth it if you like cityscapes, but not a must-see.

    - Moco Museum ‚Äì Banksy & More ‚Äî Small but pleasant museum. Fans of Banksy and modern art might enjoy it. Often overcrowded and feels a bit commercial.

    - THIS IS HOLLAND ‚Äî 5D attraction with visual effects and scents ‚Äî seems made for kids but surprises many adults. A 20-minute flight over fields and windmills. Touristy but not bad.

    - Hello Amsterdam - Introduction Walking Tour ‚Äî Depends on the guide. Some enjoy it, especially early in the trip. But if you know how to Google and walk ‚Äî you can do the same for free.

    - AMAZE ‚Äì Amsterdam ‚Äî A new immersive multimedia exhibit. Trendy among younger visitors and those wanting an ‚ÄúInstagrammable‚Äù experience. Not a museum ‚Äî an experience.

    - Rotterdam, Delft & The Hague Live Guided Tour ‚Äî The trip itself is good, but the group format gets tiring. Better to visit just one city and explore on your own.

    - Museum Het Rembrandthuis ‚Äî Small and cozy. Nicely arranged. If you're into Rembrandt ‚Äî worth visiting. Not a must-see otherwise.

    - Day Trip to Zaanse Schans Windmill Village ‚Äî Cute and photogenic, especially if you go solo. With tours ‚Äî turns into a crowded souvenir zone.

    - Dutch Craft Beer Tasting ‚Äî Good beer, but the ‚Äútasting‚Äù format feels shallow. Better to hit a solid craft beer bar.

    - Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam ‚Äî Modern art for enthusiasts. Some great works, but exhibits can be strange. If you‚Äôre ‚Äúinto it‚Äù, you‚Äôll enjoy.

    - H‚ÄôART Museum ‚Äî A new museum-partnership format (formerly Hermitage). Quality of exhibits varies. Depends on the current show.

    - Ferry to Muiderslot Castle ‚Äî Beautiful, especially in summer. But the ferry is just transport, not an attraction. Don‚Äôt go just for the ride.

    - The Murder by Dam Square ‚Äî Theatrical mystery game. Interesting in parts, but many expect more. Overrated.

    #### ‚úÖ Praised by many

    - Open Boat Cruise ‚Äî Praised for its chill atmosphere. Best taken in good weather, with no roof or crowds. Often recommended as the best way to see the city.

    - Mike‚Äôs City Highlights Bike Tour ‚Äî Praised. Great guides, relaxed vibe, and insightful context.

    - Bike Rental in Amsterdam ‚Äî Absolutely yes. Best way to explore the city. Just know the rules and respect local cyclists.

    - Bitterballen and 2 drinks at bar De Pierewaaier ‚Äî Loved for its local vibe and casual fun. Tasty and not pretentious.

    - The National Maritime Museum Amsterdam ‚Äî Underrated. Huge collection, ancient maps, docked ship. Especially great with kids.

    - Anne Frank‚Äôs Amsterdam ‚Äì Walking Tour ‚Äî Deeply emotional and informative. Guides and route praised. Book ahead with a serious company.

    - World Press Exhibition at De Nieuwe Kerk ‚Äî Powerful, moving exhibit. Especially for fans of photography, journalism, global events. Not always available.

    - The Life of Anne Frank & Neighbourhood Tour ‚Äî Atmospheric and historically meaningful. Many appreciate the walk through her neighborhood as a complement to the museum. Go with a guide.

    - Houseboat Museum ‚Äî Small but charming. A good way to understand how people really lived on the water. Worth a quick visit.
