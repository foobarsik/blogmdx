### During a Brothel Tour in Amsterdam, I Met Lucy — A 61-Year-Old Sex Worker with a Nurse’s Heart

Lucy primarily works with people with disabilities. She also works at the Prostitution Information Center.

Here’s what she shared in a Q&A session with us.

### “It’s Work. Just Like Any Other Job.”

When asked whether she views sex work like any other job, Lucy didn’t hesitate: it’s work. What makes it empowering is that she sets her own terms.

Society’s opinion varies. Amsterdam is relatively open-minded, but other areas in the Netherlands — like the conservative Bible Belt — disapprove. Ironically, some of her colleagues say that clients from those areas are among the most adventurous, likely because of repression.

### From Nursing to Providing Intimacy for People with Disabilities

Her decision to work with disabled clients stems from her nursing background. Lucy had met many people with physical or intellectual disabilities who struggled to access relationships or sex due to barriers — like the red light district being physically inaccessible for wheelchair users.

She found purpose in providing intimacy to those who need it.
After reading about an agency that connects sex workers with disabled clients, she joined them — but only after a mandatory intake interview.
These interviews are a legal requirement, both for agency and red light district workers, to ensure no one is being trafficked.
They explore a worker’s motivations, experience, and personal situation to confirm everything is voluntary.

### Legal System = Safety

The local police station has a dedicated prostitution team, specially trained to work with sex workers. There's even a 24/7 direct phone line so workers can contact them without going through regular channels.

> It’s almost like having our own private police force

That legal protection is a major reason many women from abroad choose to work in Amsterdam. They often spend 5–6 years in the red light district, working six days a week, and save enough to return home to places like Romania or Bulgaria to buy a house or start a business.

Lucy is clear: **legalizing sex work is the best way to protect workers**. In contrast, approaches like the Swedish model — where selling sex is legal but buying it isn’t — push the industry underground. Interactions become rushed, and clients are less likely to report forced prostitution or trafficking.

A journalist friend of hers noted that **in 8 out of 10 cases**, it’s the client who helps alert police or support the victim. If clients fear jail, they stay silent.

### The Difference with Female Clients

There is an escort agency in Amsterdam for female clients, but it’s a niche market. Lucy says it’s not enough to make a living from. A colleague of hers noticed that women prepare very differently — they get their hair done, set up the room with candles and flowers, dress nicely.

> In 12 years, I’ve only had one female client. She even picked up my dress from the floor and placed it on a chair. No man has ever done that.

### Fetish Clients Are Often the Easiest

Fetish clients, Lucy says, are often the most straightforward. They know what they want — and it’s usually not complicated.

Foot fetishes are common, so she keeps her nails polished. Some clients just want to lick her feet.

One older client had a fetish for shiny **PVC** — not leather or latex. He wore a full PVC suit, and Lucy did too. They danced, watched porn, had tea, and gently used handcuffs.

> I didn’t even need to undress. The red light outfits didn’t interest him at all.

Another friend of hers works as a cam girl and has a client with a gummy bear fetish — he just wants her to wear purple lipstick and eat gummy bears. That’s it.

### The Job Has Highs and Lows

Some parts of the job are genuinely enjoyable. Lucy has been taken to nice restaurants, concerts, and even the zoo — not as a date, but as a paid companion. These long appointments can be rewarding.

But window work has its own rhythm. On quiet days, she might sit for hours with only one client. She brings coffee and a radio, but it can drag.

And long escort sessions? The sex might last 7 minutes — maybe twice. The rest is conversation, and that can be exhausting.

### Saying “No” Is Part of the Job

Lucy is tired of hearing that sex workers can’t say no — especially from critics who claim that clients “buy away” consent.

> That’s nonsense. I say no all the time.

If a client won’t pay her rate, asks for something she doesn’t offer, or she just doesn’t like them — she refuses. No explanation required.

And yes — she does it for money. It’s her job.

### The 99-Year-Old “Cuddles Client”

One of Lucy’s most unusual long-term clients is a 99-year-old man with Alzheimer’s, living in a nursing home. He used to grope nurses because of his condition. Doctors considered medication, but his daughters approved an alternative: hire Lucy.

Now, he behaves better. He calls her his “cuddles lady,” and the nurses remind him when she’s coming. He even jokes about whether she’s jealous.

### Living a Double Life

Not everyone in Lucy’s life knows about her job. She’s told only a few trusted people. For others, she sticks with her old profession — “I’m still a nurse” — which explains the odd hours and missed calls.

At parties, she avoids the topic. She doesn’t use social media, doesn’t show her face, and avoids using her real name online.
Even in a country where sex work is legal, stigma is still a real threat.

Society, she notes, has become more prudish than it used to be.

> In the 1970s, people were relaxed. Now, there’s more judgment. It feels like we’re going backwards.
