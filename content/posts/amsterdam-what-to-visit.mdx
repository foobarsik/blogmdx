### Tourist traps and what we managed to visit during those 2 days

The whole center feels like one big tourist trap, but it’s not that bad — no one’s aggressively trying to sell you stuff like in Egypt.
Still, it’s hard to catch a glimpse of Dutch culture or even get a sense of what Dutch people look like because everything is tailored for tourists.

Usually, when I plan a trip, I check Reddit for local recommendations on what to skip to avoid traps or crowds, it's not perfect, but helps.
But this time was different — we just went for it.

### Brothel Tour with Former Sex Worker
Informative, respectful, educational.
Without doubt, it was my fav.
Roughly 50 minutes of talk (including a Q&A) and a 15-minute walk through the brothel.

Few facts from the top of my head:
- No one’s “pimped” Hollywood-style. *Workers are entrepreneurs*. They pay taxes. A whip is a deductible business expense.
- Sometimes it’s not about sex — it’s about mastering expensive small talk.
If a client wants to treat a performer to a drink, only champagne is offered, starting at 35 euros per glass.
Sharing a bottle is also an option, with prices ranging from 375 euros to 3,000 euros.
When a bottle is purchased, the worker receives a percentage — up to 800 or 900 euros for the priciest option.
Such sales happen roughly once every week or two, attracting wealthy clients like businessmen or celebrities.

### Cheese Tasting
Ok for the money, the guide guy was very nice, I enjoyed it, but it’s not for *advanced* cheese users, more suitable for first time cheese tasting tourists. <br />

    <figcaption>Henri inherited a goat farm and basically went, “WTF am I gonna do with all that?? Maybe cheese? Yeah, I’ll do cheese, yolo”</figcaption>
</figure>
Respect to Dutch marketing skills, they have pulled off the ultimate cheese con.
They took one recipe, split it into a thousand timelines, sprinkled it with cumin, truffle, or lavender, gave each version a new label — and sold the world a dream of endless variety.
Meanwhile, the French are still in a cave somewhere, arguing about mold and terroir.
France makes 400 kinds of cheese, the Netherlands makes 400 kinds of Gouda.

Each of us got *four* pieces of different cheeses (plus mustard and some cheese dip souse) and a glass of wine. My fav was probably *Goat Extra Old*.

And at the end, there was an unexpected bonus – something that looked like swiss *Tête de Moine*, cheese that isn’t sliced but shaved into delicate rosettes using a special tool called a girolle.
This technique releases its full nutty, creamy aroma and turns cheese into edible petals.
Each rosette was served with wine-soaked grapes – soft, rich, and slightly boozy, like tiny flavor bombs.

### Sexmuseum
Ok for it's *relatively* low price, though you can visit one of the Sex Shops in the Red-light district to see sex-related items for free.

Altogether it feels like someone’s garage full of sex-related collectibles: coconut in the form of ass, mechanical dudes with boners, vintage posters, nude photos, NSFW art, vulva-cake.
Even the full-size figure of Marilyn Monroe, because, you know, she was a *sex* symbol. My fav was probably Asian area.

    <figcaption>“The Dream of the Fisherman’s Wife” is one of the earliest and most iconic tentacle-erotic artworks in history.

### Heineken Experience
Considered one of the top tourist traps. Locals don’t go there.
Boring, expensive, and the drinks at the end don’t redeem it.

I don’t like beer and only went along with friends.
Knew I wouldn’t enjoy and had low expectations, but it’s still managed to disappoint me.
The worst part was sitting in a dark room, staring at a big screen showing us promo video with how bottles get filled with beer and magically teleport to a party.
Meanwhile, I’m just sitting there watching people on screen have fun, like some background NPC.
Not enjoying something is one thing. But feeling like a moron — that’s a new level.
And way too many people at once — we couldn’t even find a place to sit with our drinks.

Any random bar would’ve been a better choice.

### House of Bols
Ok for cocktail lovers, though short. We had an audio guide – I dislike those things and strongly prefer a human one, so that was big meh for me.
The atmosphere was nice, quiet, not crowded.

### The Bulldog Boat
Chill, fun ride on the boat, especially at the end of the day. Not too historical — just good vibes.
<figure>
    <ImageZoom src="/images/amsterdam/ship0.jpg" alt="Amsterdam ship" width={330}/>

### Rijksmuseum
The national museum of the Netherlands focused mainly on Dutch art, history, and culture — Rembrandt, Vermeer, weapons collections, ship models.

Doing a museum like this with four friends is a struggle — everyone has their own taste and tempo, and it turns into a low-key logistical nightmare.

In such museums I usually need a guide to keep me engaged — without one, it’s just old stuff and guesswork.
Didn’t make it to the end, but found a few gems along the way.

### Micropia
Mixed feelings. I think they did a pretty good job for a Museum of Microbes, but I expected more personal interactions.

The most interesting part was this Body-Based Interface.
I missed era of Kinect, never tried anything like that before.
No controllers, no gloves, no setup. Just walk up and wave.

<div className="video-center">
    <video controls width="300" poster="/images/amsterdam/micropia.jpg">

<details>
    <summary>How it works</summary>
    - Likely uses infrared depth sensors (like Kinect or Leap Motion)
    - Tracks skeleton joints in real time
    - Recognizes hovering gestures, not taps
    - UI responds to hand distance + location, not pressure

    ### Your hand becomes the cursor — and it's visible
    Both hands glow like flashlights. Even the one holding a phone was accurately tracked.
    This feedback is critical — you know where your interaction point is and how much to adjust.

    ### Tapping instinct runs deep
    Unintentionally I always wanted to “tap” invisible buttons in the air.

    ### The onboarding failed for me
    I didn’t see the instruction at the bottom corner to “hover” — just started waving out of instinct.
    The first screen prioritized microbe facts — not how to interact.

    ### Real-time skeleton mirroring feels alive
    The mirrored figure reacts instantly to posture, arm movement, even slight head tilt.
    It’s intuitive and delightful. Like a ghostly puppet of yourself.

    ### One-handed use never worked
    Tried using just one hand while holding my phone — didn’t work.
    You need both hands free to comfortably navigate both sides of the interface.

    ### People walking by = input disruption
    If someone crosses between you and the screen (or better say the camera), tracking breaks.
    Not ideal for crowded or public spaces.

    ### Feedback is minimal but effective
    Light “click” sounds + subtle visual pulses confirm interaction.

    *I feel like the only good use case for this kind of UI is showing something educational about your body.
    Anything else I can think of right now would benefit more from other UI options.*

### Escape Room "The Alchemist"
In terms of fanciness, it easily outranks any other escape room I’ve been to — really well done.
But for me, it wasn’t worth it.
It’s like going to an expensive restaurant — not everyone’s vibe.
Honestly, I had more fun in a local crappy escape room with half-working props.
The others seemed to love it, though.

### Westerpark
It's my favorite kind of park — the type where people are just lying on the grass near water and chilling.
It wasn’t overcrowded in the evening, has a nice view, and the people were so relaxed that I totally vibed with the atmosphere.
I didn’t plan to go there — I was just passing by — but I couldn’t resist and ended up spending few hours hanging out with the ducks.

Unlike Vondelpark, Westerpark doesn’t feel touristy at all.

    <summary>Reddit recommendations</summary>
    #### 🤡 Better Skip

    - Madame Tussauds Amsterdam — Commonly rated as overrated. Same wax figures as in other cities, just fewer. Crowds, noise, and all for a couple of selfies.

    - The Amsterdam Dungeon — Horror theatre with overacting actors. Many call it a "waste of money". Only for fans of spooky English-style humor.

    - Zaanse Schans Bus Excursion — Often slammed as an overpriced trap. Better to go by train on your own. The bus tour is boring and costly.

    - The Upside Down Amsterdam — Insta-trap. Photo zones with upside-down rooms. Kids might enjoy it, but adults are often disappointed.

    - Giethoorn Day Trip Including Canal Tour — Widely seen as a trap. Lots of buses, crowds, and expensive. Pretty, but feels like a tourist set.

    - Volendam & Zaanse Schans Windmills Bus Excursion — Typical checklist tour — take photos, see cheese and clogs, leave. Purely touristy, no soul.

    - WONDR Experience — Another Insta-trap. Looks nice, but zero substance. Adults without kids are usually disappointed.

    - Day Trip to the Cheese Markets in Gouda or Alkmaar — Pure tourist theatre. Crowds and staged auctions. The cheese isn’t that different from stores.

    - Royal Experience – Royal Coster Diamonds — Jewelry sales disguised as a tour. Borderline scammy. Best avoided.

    - Rembrandt’s Amsterdam Experience — A trap. Short multimedia showroom mimicking a studio. Go to the real Rembrandthuis instead.

    - Pedal Boat Amsterdam — Sounds fun, but tiring and awkward in practice. You’ll block other boats and get exhausted. A normal cruise is better.

    #### 🤔 Mixed Reviews

    - Amsterdam Canal Cruise — Recommended, especially in the evening. Beautiful views and a good intro to the city. Better to pick smaller companies or an open-boat without an audio guide.

    - A'DAM Lookout — Nice panoramic view, but the swing ride is pure tourist bait. Worth it if you like cityscapes, but not a must-see.

    - Moco Museum – Banksy & More — Small but pleasant museum. Fans of Banksy and modern art might enjoy it. Often overcrowded and feels a bit commercial.

    - THIS IS HOLLAND — 5D attraction with visual effects and scents — seems made for kids but surprises many adults. A 20-minute flight over fields and windmills. Touristy but not bad.

    - Hello Amsterdam - Introduction Walking Tour — Depends on the guide. Some enjoy it, especially early in the trip. But if you know how to Google and walk — you can do the same for free.

    - AMAZE – Amsterdam — A new immersive multimedia exhibit. Trendy among younger visitors and those wanting an “Instagrammable” experience. Not a museum — an experience.

    - Rotterdam, Delft & The Hague Live Guided Tour — The trip itself is good, but the group format gets tiring. Better to visit just one city and explore on your own.

    - Museum Het Rembrandthuis — Small and cozy. Nicely arranged. If you're into Rembrandt — worth visiting. Not a must-see otherwise.

    - Day Trip to Zaanse Schans Windmill Village — Cute and photogenic, especially if you go solo. With tours — turns into a crowded souvenir zone.

    - Dutch Craft Beer Tasting — Good beer, but the “tasting” format feels shallow. Better to hit a solid craft beer bar.

    - Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam — Modern art for enthusiasts. Some great works, but exhibits can be strange. If you’re “into it”, you’ll enjoy.

    - H’ART Museum — A new museum-partnership format (formerly Hermitage). Quality of exhibits varies. Depends on the current show.

    - Ferry to Muiderslot Castle — Beautiful, especially in summer. But the ferry is just transport, not an attraction. Don’t go just for the ride.

    - The Murder by Dam Square — Theatrical mystery game. Interesting in parts, but many expect more. Overrated.

    #### ✅ Praised by many

    - Open Boat Cruise — Praised for its chill atmosphere. Best taken in good weather, with no roof or crowds. Often recommended as the best way to see the city.

    - Mike’s City Highlights Bike Tour — Praised. Great guides, relaxed vibe, and insightful context.

    - Bike Rental in Amsterdam — Absolutely yes. Best way to explore the city. Just know the rules and respect local cyclists.

    - Bitterballen and 2 drinks at bar De Pierewaaier — Loved for its local vibe and casual fun. Tasty and not pretentious.

    - The National Maritime Museum Amsterdam — Underrated. Huge collection, ancient maps, docked ship. Especially great with kids.

    - Anne Frank’s Amsterdam – Walking Tour — Deeply emotional and informative. Guides and route praised. Book ahead with a serious company.

    - World Press Exhibition at De Nieuwe Kerk — Powerful, moving exhibit. Especially for fans of photography, journalism, global events. Not always available.

    - The Life of Anne Frank & Neighbourhood Tour — Atmospheric and historically meaningful. Many appreciate the walk through her neighborhood as a complement to the museum. Go with a guide.

    - Houseboat Museum — Small but charming. A good way to understand how people really lived on the water. Worth a quick visit.
